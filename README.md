## Concealing Interests of Passive Users in Social Media

### Abstract

User profiling has existed in the social media since their inception and
has supported most of their business model. Even if users do not actively share the
information about themselves on the social media (so-called passive users), they
can still be profiled based on their location and who they follow. Here
we present a system that leverages the linking of followed (popular) Twitter users
to DBpedia, and the information therein contained, to help users concealing their
digital footprint. Specifically, our approach helps a passive Twitter user to stay
private by proposing a list of additional profiles to follow that would confuse the
social mediaâ€™s inference pipeline and prevent it from inferring useful information
about that passive user and his interests.

### Source code

The code in this repository covers the extraction of ISWC authors, mapping the user to category distributon, a number of concealing approaches explained in our paper and the evaluation pipelines to validate our system.
